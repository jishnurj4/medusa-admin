/**
 * ## Overview
 *
 * A fulfillment provider is the shipping provider used to fulfill orders and deliver them to customers. An example of a fulfillment provider is FedEx.
 *
 * By default, a Medusa Backend has a `manual` fulfillment provider which has minimal implementation. It allows you to accept orders and fulfill them manually. However, you can integrate any fulfillment provider into Medusa, and your fulfillment provider can interact with third-party shipping providers.
 *
 * A fulfillment provider is a service that extends the `AbstractFulfillmentService` and implements its methods. So, adding a fulfillment provider is as simple as creating a service file in `src/services`.
 * The file's name is the fulfillment provider's class name as a slug and without the word `Service`. For example, if you're creating a `MyFulfillmentService` class, the file name is `src/services/my-fulfillment.ts`.
 *
 * ```ts title="src/services/my-fulfillment.ts"
 * import { AbstractFulfillmentService } from "@medusajs/medusa"
 *
 * class MyFulfillmentService extends AbstractFulfillmentService {
 *   // methods here...
 * }
 *
 * export default MyFulfillmentService
 * ```
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ## Identifier Property
 *
 * The `FulfillmentProvider` entity has 2 properties: `identifier` and `is_installed`. The `identifier` property in the fulfillment provider service is used when the fulfillment provider is added to the database.
 *
 * The value of this property is also used to reference the fulfillment provider throughout Medusa. For example, it is used to [add a fulfillment provider](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#regions_postregionsregionfulfillmentproviders) to a region.
 *
 * ```ts
 * class MyFulfillmentService extends AbstractFulfillmentService {
 *   static identifier = "my-fulfillment"
 *
 *   // ...
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ---

export interface FulfillmentService extends TransactionBaseService {
    /**
     * @ignore

    getIdentifier(): string;
    /**
     * This method is used when retrieving the list of fulfillment options available in a region, particularly by the [List Fulfillment Options API Route](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#regions_getregionsregionfulfillmentoptions).
     * For example, if youâ€™re integrating UPS as a fulfillment provider, you might support two fulfillment options: UPS Express Shipping and UPS Access Point. Each of these options can have different data associated with them.
     *
     * @returns {Promise<any[]>} The list of fulfillment options. These options don't have any required format. Later on, these options can be used when creating a shipping option,
     * such as when using the [Create Shipping Option API Route](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#shipping-options_postshippingoptions). The chosen fulfillment option, which is one of the
     * items in the array returned by this method, will be set in the `data` object of the shipping option.
     *
     * @example

    /**
     * This method is called when a shipping method is created. This typically happens when the customer chooses a shipping option during checkout, when a shipping method is created
     * for an order return, or in other similar cases. The shipping option and its data are validated before the shipping method is created.
     *
     * You can use the provided parameters to validate the chosen shipping option. For example, you can check if the `data` object passed as a second parameter includes all data needed to
     * fulfill the shipment later on.
     *
     * If any of the data is invalid, you can throw an error. This error will stop Medusa from creating a shipping method and the error message will be returned as a result of the API Route.
     *
     * @param {ShippingOptionData} optionData - The data object of the shipping option selected when creating the shipping method.
     * @param {FulfillmentProviderData} data - The `data` object passed in the body of the request.
     * @param {Cart} cart - The customer's cart details. It may be empty if the shipping method isn't associated with a cart, such as when it's associated with a claim.
     * @returns {Promise<Record<string, unknown>>} The data that will be stored in the `data` property of the shipping method to be created.
     * Make sure the value you return contains everything you need to fulfill the shipment later on. The returned value may also be used to calculate the price of the shipping method
     * if it doesn't have a set price. It will be passed along to the {@link calculatePrice} method.
     *
     * @example
     * class MyFulfillmentService extends AbstractFulfillmentService {

     *   async validateFulfillmentData(

     *
     * @param {ShippingOptionData} data - The `data` object of the shipping option being created. You can use this data to determine whether the shipping option should be calculated or not.
     * This is useful if the fulfillment provider you are integrating has both flat rate and dynamically priced fulfillment options.
     * @returns {Promise<boolean>} If this method returns `true`, that means that the price can be calculated dynamically and the shipping option can have the `price_type` set to calculated.

     * 2. If the price is being calculated when the shipping method is being created, it's the data returned by the {@link validateFulfillmentData} method used during the shipping method creation.
     * 3. If the price is being calculated while calculating the cart's totals, it will be the data object of the cart's shipping method.
     * @param {Cart} cart - Either the Cart or the Order object.
     * @returns {Promise<number>} Used to set the price of the shipping method or option, based on the context the method is used in.
