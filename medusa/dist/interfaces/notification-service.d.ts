/**
 * ## Overview
 *
 * :::note[Prerequisites]
 *
 * Before creating a Notification Provider, [install an event bus module](https://docs.medusajs.com/development/events/modules/redis).
 *
 * :::
 *
 * A Notification Provider is a provider that handles sending and resending of notifications.
 *
 * To create a Notification Provider, create a TypeScript or JavaScript file in `src/services`. The name of the file is the name of the provider
 * (for example, `sendgrid.ts`). The file must export a class that extends the `AbstractNotificationService` class imported from `@medusajs/medusa`.
 *
 * For example, create the file `src/services/email-sender.ts` with the following content:
 *
 * ```ts title="src/services/email-sender.ts"
 * import { AbstractNotificationService } from "@medusajs/medusa"
 * import { EntityManager } from "typeorm"
 *
 * class EmailSenderService extends AbstractNotificationService {
 *   protected manager_: EntityManager
 *   protected transactionManager_: EntityManager
 *
 *   sendNotification(
 *     event: string,
 *     data: unknown,
 *     attachmentGenerator: unknown
 *   ): Promise<{
 *       to: string;
 *       status: string;
 *       data: Record<string, unknown>;
 *     }> {
 *     throw new Error("Method not implemented.")
 *   }
 *   resendNotification(
 *     notification: unknown,
 *     config: unknown,
 *     attachmentGenerator: unknown
 *   ): Promise<{
 *       to: string;
 *       status: string;
 *       data: Record<string, unknown>;
 *     }> {
 *     throw new Error("Method not implemented.")
 *   }
 *
 * }
 *
 * export default EmailSenderService
 * ```
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ## Identifier Property
 *
 * The `NotificationProvider` entity has 2 properties: `identifier` and `is_installed`. The value of the `identifier` property in the notification provider
 * class is used when the Notification Provider is created in the database.
 *
 * The value of this property is also used later when you want to subscribe the Notification Provider to events in a [Loader](https://docs.medusajs.com/development/loaders/overview).
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * ```ts
 * class EmailSenderService extends AbstractNotificationService {
 *   static identifier = "email-sender"
 *   // ...
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ---
