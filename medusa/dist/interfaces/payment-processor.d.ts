/**
 * ## Overview
 *
 * A Payment Processor is the payment method used to authorize, capture, and refund payment, among other actions. An example of a Payment Processor is Stripe.
 *
 * By default, Medusa has a `manual` payment provider that has minimal implementation. It can be synonymous with a Cash on Delivery payment method. It allows
 * store operators to manage the payment themselves but still keep track of its different stages on Medusa.
 *
 * A payment processor is a service that extends the `AbstractPaymentProcessor` and implements its methods. So, adding a Payment Processor is as simple as
 * creating a service file in `src/services`. The file's name is the payment processor's class name as a slug and without the word `Service`.
 * For example, if you're creating a `MyPaymentService` class, the file name is `src/services/my-payment.ts`.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { AbstractPaymentProcessor } from "@medusajs/medusa";
 *
 * class MyPaymentService extends AbstractPaymentProcessor {
 *   // methods here...
 * }
 *
 * export default MyPaymentService
 * ```
 *
 * The methods of the payment processor are used at different points in the Checkout flow as well as when processing an order after it’s placed.
 *
 * ![Checkout Flow - Payment](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1680177820/Medusa%20Docs/Diagrams/checkout-payment_cy9efp.jpg)
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ## Identifier Property
 *
 * The `PaymentProvider` entity has 2 properties: `id` and `is_installed`. The `identifier` property in the payment processor service is used when the payment processor is added to the database.
 *
 * The value of this property is also used to reference the payment processor throughout Medusa.
 * For example, it is used to [add a payment processor](https://docs.medusajs.com/api/admin#regions_postregionsregionpaymentproviders) to a region.
 *
 * ```ts
 * class MyPaymentService extends AbstractPaymentProcessor {
 *   static identifier = "my-payment"
 *   // ...
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ## PaymentProcessorError
 *
 * Before diving into the methods of the Payment Processor, you'll notice that part of the expected return signature of these method includes `PaymentProcessorError`.
 *
 * ```ts
 * interface PaymentProcessorError {
 *   error: string
 *   code?: string
 *   detail?: any
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * While implementing the Payment Processor's methods, if you need to inform the Medusa core that an error occurred at a certain stage,
 * return an object having the attributes defined in the `PaymentProcessorError` interface.
 *
 * For example, the Stripe payment processor has the following method to create the error object, which is used within other methods:
 *
 * ```ts
 * abstract class StripeBase extends AbstractPaymentProcessor {
 *   // ...
 *   protected buildError(
 *     message: string,
 *     e: Stripe.StripeRawError | PaymentProcessorError | Error
 *   ): PaymentProcessorError {
 *     return {
 *       error: message,
 *       code: "code" in e ? e.code : "",
 *       detail: isPaymentProcessorError(e)
 *         ? `${e.error}${EOL}${e.detail ?? ""}`
 *         : "detail" in e
 *         ? e.detail
 *         : e.message ?? "",
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 *   // used in other methods
 *   async retrievePayment(
 *     paymentSessionData: Record<string, unknown>
 *   ): Promise<
 *     PaymentProcessorError |
 *     PaymentProcessorSessionResponse["session_data"]
 *   > {
 *     try {
 *       // ...
 *     } catch (e) {
 *       return this.buildError(
 *         "An error occurred in retrievePayment",
 *         e
 *       )
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * ```

     * you can initialize it in the constructor and use it in other methods in the service.
     *
     * Additionally, if you’re creating your Payment Processor as an external plugin to be installed on any Medusa backend and you want to access the options added for the plugin,
     * you can access it in the constructor. The options are passed as a second parameter.
