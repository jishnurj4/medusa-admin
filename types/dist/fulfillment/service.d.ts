     *
     * ```ts
     * const [fulfillments, count] =
     *   await fulfillmentModuleService.listAndCountFulfillments(

     *     }
     *   )
     * ```
     *
     * By default, only the first `15` records are retrieved. You can control pagination by specifying the `skip` and `take` properties of the `config` parameter:
     *
     * ```ts
     * const [fulfillments, count] =
     *   await fulfillmentModuleService.listAndCountFulfillments({
