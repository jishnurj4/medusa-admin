/**
 * ## Overview
 *
 * A search service class is in a TypeScript or JavaScript file created in the `src/services` directory. The class must extend the `AbstractSearchService` class imported
 *  from the `@medusajs/utils` package.
 *
 * Based on services’ naming conventions, the file’s name should be the slug version of the search service’s name without `service`, and the class’s name should be the
 * pascal case of the search service’s name following by `Service`.
 *
 * For example, create the `MySearchService` class in the file `src/services/my-search.ts`:
 *
 * ```ts title="src/services/my-search.ts"
 * import { AbstractSearchService } from "@medusajs/utils"
 *
 * class MySearchService extends AbstractSearchService {
 *   isDefault = false
 *
 *   createIndex(indexName: string, options: Record<string, any>) {
 *     throw new Error("Method not implemented.")
 *   }
 *   getIndex(indexName: string) {
 *     throw new Error("Method not implemented.")
 *   }
 *   addDocuments(
 *     indexName: string,
 *     documents: Record<string, any>[],
 *     type: string
 *   ) {
 *     throw new Error("Method not implemented.")
 *   }
 *   replaceDocuments(
 *     indexName: string,
 *     documents: Record<string, any>[],
 *     type: string
 *   ) {
 *     throw new Error("Method not implemented.")
 *   }
 *   deleteDocument(
 *     indexName: string,
 *     document_id: string | number
 *   ) {
 *     throw new Error("Method not implemented.")
 *   }
 *   deleteAllDocuments(indexName: string) {
 *     throw new Error("Method not implemented.")
 *   }
 *   search(
 *     indexName: string,
 *     query: string,
 *     options: Record<string, any>
 *   ) {
 *     return {
 *       message: "test",
 *     }
 *   }
 *   updateSettings(
 *     indexName: string,
 *     settings: Record<string, any>
 *   ) {
 *     throw new Error("Method not implemented.")
 *   }
 *
 * }
 *
 * export default MySearchService
 * ```
 *

 *
 * ## Notes About Class Methods
 *
 * Although there are several helper methods in this class, the main methods used by the Medusa backend are `addDocuments`, `deleteDocument`, and `search`.
 * The rest of the methods are provided in case you need them for custom use cases.

     * You can use the `constructor` of your search service to access the different services in Medusa through dependency injection.
     *
     * You can also use the constructor to initialize your integration with the third-party provider. For example, if you use a client to connect to the third-party provider’s APIs,
     * you can initialize it in the constructor and use it in other methods in the service.
     *
     * Additionally, if you’re creating your search service as an external plugin to be installed on any Medusa backend and you want to access the options added for the plugin,
     * you can access them in the constructor. The default constructor already sets the value of the class proeprty `options_` to the passed options.
     *
     * @param {MedusaContainer} container - An instance of `MedusaContainer` that allows you to access other resources, such as services, in your Medusa backend.
     * @param {Record<string, unknown>} options - If this search service is created in a plugin, the plugin's options are passed in this parameter.
     *
     * @example
     * // ...
     * import { ProductService } from "@medusajs/medusa"
     *
     * type InjectedDependencies = {
     *   productService: ProductService

     *     // @ts-expect-error prefer-rest-params
     *     super(...arguments)
     *     this.productService_ = productService
     *
     *     // you can also initialize a client that
     *     // communicates with a third-party service.
     *     this.client = new Client(options)

     * This method is used to create an index in the search engine.
     *
     * @param {string} indexName - The name of the index to create.
     * @param {unknown} options - Any options that may be relevant to your search service. This parameter doesn't have
     * any defined format as it depends on your custom implementation.
     * @returns {unknown} No required format of returned data, as it depends on your custom implementation.
     *
     * @example
     * An example implementation, assuming `client` would interact with a third-party service:
     *
     * ```ts title="src/services/my-search.ts"
     * class MySearchService extends AbstractSearchService {
     *   // ...

     *
     * Another example of how the [MeiliSearch plugin](https://docs.medusajs.com/plugins/search/meilisearch) uses the
     * `options` parameter:
     *
     * ```ts
     * class MeiliSearchService extends AbstractSearchService {
